This RFC was authored in the context of [Ember.jsâ€™ adoption of TypeScript as a first-class supported language][RFC #0724]. From the start, however, it was designed to be shared widely, so its recommendations are intentionally general. The authors hope that these recommendations can be widely adopted by the broader TypeScript community.

[RFC #0724]: https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/724
